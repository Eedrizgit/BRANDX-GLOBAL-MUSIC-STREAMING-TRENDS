# **Comprehensive Evaluation Global Music Streaming**

# Overview
The BRANDX Global Music Streaming Trends analysis provides a comprehensive snapshot of how global audiences consume music across platforms, genres, and user types. By examining key metrics such as most streamed genres, subscription-based engagement patterns, platform usage, top-performing artists, and regional activity, the analysis reveals the listening behaviors shaping today’s digital music landscape. With peak streaming times and fan preferences also captured, these findings are presented through a dynamic, interactive dashboard designed to offer actionable insights into evolving music trends worldwide. 

# Objectives
Global music streaming platforms face intense competition and struggle to fully understand diverse listener behaviors across regions, platforms, and subscription models. Without robust, data-driven insights into when, where, and how users engage with music, platforms risk missing critical opportunities to enhance user experiences and drive retention. This project aims to uncover key patterns in genre preference, subscription impact, and artist engagement to guide strategic improvements.

# Tools used
Microsoft Excel - data cleaning, pivotcharts, dashboard creation using icons and slicers

# Data
User ID, Age, Country, Streaming Platform, Top Genre, Number of Songs Liked, Subscription Type, Listening Time (Morning/Afternoon/Night), Minutes Streamed Per Day, Discover Weekly Engagement %, and Repeat Songs %.

This analysis helps the music streaming industry understand how people listen to music. Streaming platforms can use it to improve user experience and keep listeners engaged. Artists and record labels can see which genres and artists get the most streams, helping them plan better. Advertisers can target users based on their listening habits, and investors can spot new opportunities in the industry. Overall, it helps industry players track trends and make smarter decisions.

# Takeaway

These insights give a clear picture of global music streaming trends. At first, it seemed like Spotify or Apple Music would have the highest streaming time, but the analysis showed that Tidal led instead. It was also expected that free users would stream more since they don’t have to pay, but the data proved otherwise, premium users streamed more. Rock was expected to be the most streamed genre, and the analysis confirmed it. But surprisingly, Bad Bunny, the most streamed artist, is not a Rock artist, showing that genre popularity doesn’t always match artist dominance.

For streaming time, the assumption was that afternoon would have the highest minutes, but it turned out that users stream more at night, likely when they are winding down for the day. Lastly, it was expected that the US or UK would have the most streaming activity, but Australia led instead.

The data challenged a lot of initial expectations and gave a clearer view of how users actually engage with music.

# Recommendation

1. Prioritize Rock Genre in Promotions
   
Since Rock is the most streamed genre (167,367 minutes), platforms and marketers should center playlist curation, ads, and featured content around Rock to maximize engagement.

3. Invest More in Premium User Experience
   
Premium users stream more (780,281 minutes) than free users, indicating stronger engagement. Offering exclusive features, early access to new releases, or loyalty perks can further boost their retention and satisfaction.

4. Strengthen Tidal’s Competitive Edge
   
Tidal leads in total minutes streamed (267,659). The platform should capitalize on this by reinforcing its brand messaging around high-quality streaming and artist-centric features to retain and grow its user base.

5. Boost Artist Engagement Using Bad Bunny as Benchmark
   
Bad Bunny tops both most streamed (163,843 minutes) and most liked songs (138,649). Streaming services should use his strategy as a case study to boost engagement for emerging artists — possibly through curated collaborations or algorithm-driven visibility.

6. Leverage Nighttime Listening Trends
   
With the highest streaming occurring at night (541,043 minutes), release strategies and exclusive content drops should be timed to coincide with peak nighttime usage for maximum visibility and user response.

7. Explore Australia as a High-Value Market
   
Australia recorded the highest streaming activity (165,626 minutes), suggesting it’s a lucrative market. Streaming services should consider region-specific marketing campaigns and local artist features to strengthen presence.

9. Understand Cross-Genre Appeal Beyond Genre Leaders
    
Although Rock leads by genre, Bad Bunny (not a rock artist) dominates artist streaming and likes. Platforms should not assume genre leaders dictate artist dominance; cross-genre targeting and broader music recommendations can increase user discovery.

11. Rethink Geographic and Time-Based Assumptions
    
The USA, a traditionally dominant music market, had the lowest daily minutes streamed among top countries (143,366). Platforms should explore why engagement is lower and adapt strategies, perhaps through localized content or better cultural alignment.
